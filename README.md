# Flux.Vote

A two week code-binge to finish Flux's voting app (well, an alpha of it).

Goals:
* Mirror Parliament (all bills in parliament replicated in the voting system with a live feed that auto-updates issues)
* Petition type thing for referenda - user submitted

## Livestream

The whole thing is livestreamed. Check it, yo:
